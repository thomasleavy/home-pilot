      <li><strong>One place for everything</strong> — See and control your thermostat, hot water, lights, and sensors from the Home screen instead of juggling several apps or remotes.</li>
      <li><strong>Insights into your usage</strong> — The Insights page shows how long your heating and hot water have been on over recent days, so you can spot patterns and use energy more efficiently.</li>
      <li><strong>Your settings, your account</strong> — Your device states and preferences are stored with your account. When you log in on another device or after reinstalling, your setup is still there.</li>
      <li><strong>Discover and add devices</strong> — Use Discover to find compatible devices and add them to your home so they appear on your dashboard.</li>
      <li><strong>Support when you need it</strong> — Use the in-app guide, FAQ, and support options to get help without leaving the app.</li>
